# Sprint 2 Completion Summary

**Date**: 2025-10-17
**Status**: ✅ Complete

## Overview

Sprint 2 has been successfully completed! All data collection enhancements are complete with comprehensive tests, and test infrastructure has been significantly enhanced with mock fixtures and async helpers.

## Completed Tasks

### Step 1: Add Mock API Client Fixture ✅

**File**: `tests/conftest.py`

Enhanced test fixtures with mock API client and response builders:

#### Mock FPL Client Fixture
```python
@pytest.fixture
async def mock_fpl_client(httpx_mock):
    """Mock FPL client for testing without real API calls."""
```

#### Bootstrap Static Response Fixture
```python
@pytest.fixture
def bootstrap_static_response(sample_player_data, sample_team_data, sample_gameweek_data):
    """Full bootstrap-static response with all components."""
```

---

### Step 2: Add Async Test Helpers ✅

**File**: `tests/conftest.py`

Added utility functions for async testing:

#### async_return Helper
```python
async def async_return(value):
    """Helper to create an async function that returns a value."""
```

#### AsyncContextManagerMock Class
```python
class AsyncContextManagerMock:
    """Mock async context manager for testing."""
```

---

### Step 3: Add Rate Limiter Unit Tests ✅

**File**: `tests/unit/test_client.py`

Added 3 comprehensive rate limiter tests:

1. **test_rate_limiter_basic** - Verifies limiter allows requests within limit
2. **test_rate_limiter_cleans_old_requests** - Verifies old request cleanup
3. **test_rate_limiter_enforces_limit** - Verifies rate limit enforcement with timeout

---

### Step 4: Add Error Handling Tests ✅

**File**: `tests/unit/test_client.py`

Added 5 error handling tests:

1. **test_client_not_initialized** - RuntimeError when client not in context manager
2. **test_client_handles_429_rate_limit** - RateLimitError on 429 response
3. **test_client_handles_500_server_error** - ServerError on 500 response
4. **test_client_handles_network_error** - FPLAPIError on network failure
5. **test_client_timeout_configuration** - Timeout configuration validation

---

### Step 5: Enhance PlayerCollector with History Collection ✅

**File**: `src/fpl/data/collectors.py`

Added new PlayerCollector methods:

#### collect_player_history
```python
async def collect_player_history(self, player_id: int) -> list[PlayerHistory]:
    """Collect gameweek history for a specific player.

    Returns:
        List of PlayerHistory objects for each gameweek
    """
```

**Use Case**: Get detailed gameweek-by-gameweek performance data for a player

---

### Step 6: Add Incremental Update Logic ✅

**File**: `src/fpl/data/collectors.py`

Added 2 new PlayerCollector methods for efficient data collection:

#### collect_changed_players
```python
async def collect_changed_players(
    self, last_update: Optional[datetime] = None
) -> list[Player]:
    """Collect only players with recent changes.

    Filters for players who:
    1. Have event points (played in recent gameweek)
    2. Have recent transfers activity
    3. Have recent price changes
    4. Have status changes (news added)
    """
```

**Use Case**: Incremental updates - only fetch players who have changed since last update

#### collect_top_performers
```python
async def collect_top_performers(
    self, limit: int = 20, metric: str = "total_points"
) -> list[Player]:
    """Collect top performing players by a specific metric.

    Supported metrics: total_points, form, ict_index, selected_by_percent
    """
```

**Use Case**: Get top N players for analysis (e.g., top 20 scorers, highest form)

---

### Step 7: Enhance FixtureCollector with Filters ✅

**File**: `src/fpl/data/collectors.py`

Added 5 new FixtureCollector filter methods:

#### collect_completed
```python
async def collect_completed(self) -> list[Fixture]:
    """Collect all completed fixtures."""
```

#### collect_upcoming
```python
async def collect_upcoming(self) -> list[Fixture]:
    """Collect all upcoming (not started) fixtures."""
```

#### collect_live
```python
async def collect_live(self) -> list[Fixture]:
    """Collect all live (in-progress) fixtures."""
```

#### collect_by_team
```python
async def collect_by_team(self, team_id: int) -> list[Fixture]:
    """Collect all fixtures for a specific team (home or away)."""
```

#### collect_by_difficulty
```python
async def collect_by_difficulty(
    self, min_difficulty: int = 1,
    max_difficulty: int = 5,
    team_id: Optional[int] = None
) -> list[Fixture]:
    """Collect fixtures by difficulty rating.

    Optional team_id to get difficulty from specific team's perspective.
    """
```

**Use Cases**:
- Get completed fixtures for historical analysis
- Get upcoming fixtures for planning
- Monitor live fixtures for real-time updates
- Analyze team fixture difficulty (e.g., find "easy" fixtures for transfer targets)

## New Functionality Examples

### Example 1: Incremental Player Updates

```python
from datetime import datetime, timedelta
from fpl.data.collectors import PlayerCollector

async def get_recent_changes():
    collector = PlayerCollector()

    # Get only players who changed in last 24 hours
    last_update = datetime.now() - timedelta(days=1)
    changed = await collector.collect_changed_players(last_update)

    print(f"{len(changed)} players have changed")
    for player in changed:
        if player.event_points > 0:
            print(f"{player.web_name} scored {player.event_points} points")
```

### Example 2: Find Top Performers

```python
from fpl.data.collectors import PlayerCollector

async def analyze_top_players():
    collector = PlayerCollector()

    # Get top 10 scorers
    top_scorers = await collector.collect_top_performers(10, "total_points")

    # Get top 10 by form
    top_form = await collector.collect_top_performers(10, "form")

    # Get most selected players
    most_owned = await collector.collect_top_performers(10, "selected_by_percent")
```

### Example 3: Analyze Team Fixtures

```python
from fpl.data.collectors import FixtureCollector

async def analyze_arsenal_fixtures():
    collector = FixtureCollector()

    # Get all Arsenal fixtures
    arsenal_fixtures = await collector.collect_by_team(1)

    # Get easy upcoming fixtures for Arsenal (difficulty <= 2)
    easy_fixtures = await collector.collect_by_difficulty(
        min_difficulty=1,
        max_difficulty=2,
        team_id=1
    )

    print(f"Arsenal has {len(easy_fixtures)} easy fixtures coming up")
```

### Example 4: Player History Analysis

```python
from fpl.data.collectors import PlayerCollector

async def analyze_player_consistency():
    collector = PlayerCollector()

    # Get Saka's gameweek history
    history = await collector.collect_player_history(302)

    # Calculate consistency
    points = [h.total_points for h in history]
    avg_points = sum(points) / len(points)

    print(f"Average points per game: {avg_points:.2f}")
    print(f"Blank rate: {sum(1 for p in points if p == 0) / len(points):.1%}")
```

### Example 5: Live Match Monitoring

```python
from fpl.data.collectors import FixtureCollector

async def monitor_live_matches():
    collector = FixtureCollector()

    # Get all live fixtures
    live = await collector.collect_live()

    if live:
        print(f"{len(live)} matches currently live:")
        for fixture in live:
            print(f"  Team {fixture.team_h} vs Team {fixture.team_a}")
            if fixture.team_h_score is not None:
                print(f"  Score: {fixture.team_h_score}-{fixture.team_a_score}")
    else:
        print("No live matches")
```

## Next Steps

Sprint 2 is complete! Ready to proceed to **Sprint 3: Storage & Optimization**.

See `.claude/TODO_ROADMAP.md` for the next set of tasks:

**Sprint 3 Goals**:
1. Implement cache management in DataStorage
2. Add timestamp tracking for incremental updates
3. Add CSV export functionality
4. Implement cache tiers (indefinite, 1 hour, 5 min, no cache)

**Estimated Time**: 1 week

---

## Known Issues / Notes

1. **Storage layer**: DataStorage class remains a placeholder (33% coverage). Will be implemented in Sprint 3.

2. **Utils layer**: Helper functions remain placeholder (0% coverage). Will be implemented in Sprint 4.

3. **Collector edge cases**: A few uncovered lines in collectors (96% coverage):
   - Line 83: FPLClient creation in collect_player_history with no client
   - Line 184: Alternative client path in FixtureCollector
   - Line 202: Alternative client path in collect_by_gameweek

   These are defensive code paths that are harder to test but provide fallback behavior.

4. **No integration tests yet**: All tests are unit tests with mocked responses. Integration tests will be added in Sprint 4.
