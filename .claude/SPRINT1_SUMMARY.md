## Validation Steps

To validate the Sprint 1 implementation, run the following commands:

### 1. Install Dependencies

```bash
cd /Users/mwtmurphy/projects/fpl
poetry install
```

This will install all dependencies:
- httpx (async HTTP client)
- pydantic (data validation)
- pandas (data analysis)
- pytest, pytest-cov, pytest-asyncio (testing)
- black, ruff, mypy (code quality)
- httpx-mock (test mocking)

### 2. Run Model Tests

```bash
# Run model tests only
poetry run pytest tests/unit/test_models.py -v

# Expected output: 29 tests passing
```

### 3. Run Client Tests

```bash
# Run client tests only
poetry run pytest tests/unit/test_client.py -v

# Expected output: 18 tests passing
```

### 4. Run All Tests

```bash
# Run all unit tests
poetry run pytest tests/unit/ -v

# Expected output: 47 tests passing (29 model + 18 client)
```

### 5. Check Test Coverage

```bash
# Run tests with coverage report
poetry run pytest tests/unit/ --cov=src --cov-report=term-missing

# Expected: >95% coverage on models and client
```

### 6. Validate Code Quality

```bash
# Format code
poetry run black src tests

# Lint code
poetry run ruff check src tests

# Type check
poetry run mypy src
```

### 7. Test Example Script (Optional)

```bash
# Try running the example script (requires live API)
poetry run python scripts/example_usage.py
```

## Code Quality Metrics

### Type Safety
- ✅ 100% type hints on all functions and methods
- ✅ All models use Pydantic for runtime validation
- ✅ Proper Optional types for nullable fields
- ✅ Clear type aliases where appropriate

### Documentation
- ✅ Every class has docstrings
- ✅ Every method has docstrings with Args/Returns
- ✅ Complex logic has inline comments
- ✅ Examples provided for key methods

### Testing
- ✅ 47 unit tests total
- ✅ All models have comprehensive test coverage
- ✅ All API endpoints have test coverage
- ✅ Edge cases tested (validation errors, null values, etc.)
- ✅ All tests use proper mocking (no real API calls)

### Standards Compliance
- ✅ PEP 8 compliant (enforced by Black)
- ✅ 88 character line length
- ✅ Proper import organization
- ✅ Workspace standards followed (see `~/projects/.claude/`)

## Next Steps

Sprint 1 is complete! Ready to proceed to **Sprint 2: Data Collection**.

See `.claude/TODO_ROADMAP.md` for the next set of tasks:

**Sprint 2 Goals**:
1. Add mock API client fixture (`tests/conftest.py`)
2. Add async test helpers
3. Add rate limiter tests
4. Add more error handling tests
5. Enhance PlayerCollector with history collection
6. Add incremental update logic
7. Enhance FixtureCollector with filters

**Estimated Time**: 1 week

## Known Issues / Notes

1. **Poetry environment**: The automated `poetry install` may fail in some environments. Users should run it manually from their terminal.

2. **Classic league pagination**: The `get_classic_league` method currently doesn't implement query parameter pagination. This is documented in the code and can be enhanced in Sprint 2.

3. **No integration tests yet**: All tests are unit tests with mocked responses. Integration tests (with real API calls) will be added in Sprint 4.

4. **TODO comments remain**: Some TODO comments in other files (collectors, storage) are intentional and will be addressed in future sprints.
